# ArduinoBirds
A repository for my 2023 DNID Arduino project. 
The code includes 
  - A servo motor that makes one of the birds peck a pie when a button is pressed. 
  - Another servo motor that causes the arrow to move, foreshadowing Cock Robin's imminent death
 Two leds are also set up for mood lighting, though these do not need to be turned off or changed in any way so they are not reflected in the code.
 
 
 Problems
 - This is not as much a problem but more of a design change. We originally were going to have the Sparrow shoot the arrow at Cock Robin and have it actually hit him,
 but we decided against it because it would be a pain to set up after execution and also a potential hazard to those viewing our project. I did have an idea developed to
 make this happen, but it also might have overheated the servo motor so I am glad we are no longer going this route. Instead, we are having the arrow wiggle to simply
 foreshadow our groom's death.
 - I could not get anything to work for a long time, and if it did work it was inconsistent. We eventually found out that this was due to the breadboard (and potentially
 other components) being broken. This did not cause us to change our deisgn in any way, but it was definitely the biggest problem we had in the whole project. 

Overall, we did not change much after our initial brainstorming session. We changed the arrow idea the week after we got our arduino kits, so no actual code had to be
altered. It was more of a 'We thought this through and do not like this idea in practice' rather than 'An issue arised and we had to change our design'. Besides that,
all of our mechanics and visuals stayed pretty much entirely the same. This is really good because it was all a lot of work and materials and it took us the entire time
alloted to us to create. I think we were really lucky in that we didn't have to change much, and the project turned out even prettier than I originally imagined it would.
